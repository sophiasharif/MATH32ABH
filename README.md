# honors-multivariable-calculus

This repo contains my challenge problem reports from my honors multivariable calculus course. These were technical writing assignments where we were given a week to write a polished report solving a real-world math problem.

## Report 1 - Linear Maps, Eigenvectors, and Eigenvalues

Report 1 explores the geometry of two-dimensional linear maps. The first section studies how to understand linear maps as transformations of _e<sub>1</sub>_ and _e<sub>2</sub>_. The second section investigates how to calculate the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of linear maps _R<sub>2</sub>â†’R<sub>2</sub>_.

## Report 2 - Polar Limits, Epsilon-Delta Definition of Limits

This report examines the conditions under which polar coordinates can be used to calculate limits. The first section explores the properties of polar coordinates and proves the polar method works using the epsilon-delta definition of limits. The second section investigates an interesting case when polar coordinates fail to calculate a limit correctly.

## Report 3 - Curvature and the Frenet Frame

Report 3 investigates the calculus of vector-valued functions, the Frenet Frame, and curvature. The first part proves useful properties of the Frenet Frame, namely that it is an orthonormal basis and that it is identical for all possible parametrizations of a curve. The second part is a case study of curvature and includes a proof for an alternate curvature formula.

## Report 4 - Optimization over Tolerance Intervals with LaGrange Multipliers

This report solves a real-world problem by the volume to surface area ratio of a can. The first section finds the dimensions of a can with minimal surface area given a fixed volume and a can with maximal volume given a fixed surface area. This includes an investigation of why it does not make sense to find the maximal surface area of a can of fixed volume or the minimal volume of a can with fixed surface area. The second section uses tolerance intervales to optimize the "ideal can" found in the first part to account for error in manufacturing machines.
