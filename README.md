# honors-multivariable-calculus

This repo contains my challenge problem reports from my honors multivariable calculus course. These were technical writing assignments where we were given a week to write a polished report solving a real-world math problem.

## Report 1 - Linear Maps, Eigenvectors, and Eigenvalues

Report 1 explores the geometry of two-dimensional linear maps. The first section studies how to understand linear maps as transformations of e1 and e2. The second section investigates how to calculate the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of linear maps R~2~â†’R~2~.
